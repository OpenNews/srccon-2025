        \nTogether, we'll explore the urgent questions facing our industry: Who decides what ethical AI use looks like in your organization? How do we protect against bias and misinformation? Where's the line between efficiency and authenticity in audience engagement?
        
        \nThrough interactive exercises, real-world scenarios, and collaborative policy-building (starting with an improv ice breaker!), you'll leave with a draft AI ethics framework tailored to your newsroom's needs and concrete strategies to advocate for responsible AI adoption. This isn't about theoretical discussions - it's about creating practical guardrails that protect journalistic integrity while embracing innovation. Because if we don't proactively shape how AI is used in our organizations, corporate priorities will do it for us."

We offer help desks and consultations, embeddable graphics and data reports, along with free illustrations, expert sources, interview questions, webinars, and more. Now that we've put out a buffet of products, we want to know how local journalists view them. Are they helpful? Would something else be better? Would you actually use these products again and again, or are they just a random one-off? This will be a candid, exploratory session with lots of product demos and ample discussion of how and if local journalists can really use these resources. "

        \nWe are also developing a framework through machine learning to systematically categorize content the Star Tribune produces, allowing us to find what kinds of stories do better and bring that insight to the newsroom.

But we've gone beyond just sharing stories. We've developed a training pipeline for nontraditional reporters, built custom tech tools to streamline collaboration, and launched a collective fundraising model to sustain local news. Now, we want to workshop how others can adapt and expand this model to strengthen their own news ecosystems.
        
        \nThis interactive, hands-on session will explore what true resource-sharing and collaboration can look like – beyond just swapping stories. Together, we'll map out challenges, identify opportunities, and design solutions for deeper collaboration in our own communities. We'll dig into cultural barriers, workflow hacks, and funding strategies that make collaboration work (and last). Attendees will leave with practical, replicable frameworks and fresh ideas to bring back to their newsrooms – because what we're building doesn't have to be unique.

In the face of these forces, solidarity economies, movement journalism, and worker-run media offer alternative ways to build and sustain newsrooms that prioritize people over profit. In this session, we will expose how neoliberalism has shaped the media industry, while highlighting successful models of solidarity-based journalism, including worker-owned co-ops, crowdfunded newsrooms and movement-driven outlets. 
        
        \nThrough group discussions and case studies, we will explore how journalists can collaborate with social justice movements -- such as labor, housing, environmental justice -- to strengthen collective resistance. Together, we will brainstorm strategies for building media that serves movements as a tool for liberation, and we will map out a constellation of resistance-driven media projects.

While some publications have taken steps to address this demand by hiring translators, translation can be a resource-intensive task, particularly for smaller newsrooms. Tools like Google Translate can aid translation efforts by translating large amounts of text quickly and cheaply in more than 100 languages.
        
        \nThis interactive workshop will provide an overview of how we translate our stories at Rest of World, including how we've used both human translators and automatic machine translations to reach audiences around the world. We'll discuss our process for selecting languages for machine translation, as well as the limitations of this technology. This session will also include an interactive component where attendees will learn how to implement translations using Google's Cloud Translation API or Libre Translate on their own websites."

        "description": "Errors are inevitable, but how we handle them defines our credibility. In this session we'll explore the counterintuitive idea that acknowledging and correcting mistakes can actually strengthen audience trust. Instead of treating mistakes as failures, what if we saw them as opportunities for transparency and engagement? How might we learn from our mistakes to improve our process?
        
        \nWe'll talk about why mistakes can build trust, the impact of visible corrections, and best practices for holding yourself accountable and addressing mistakes. Participants will map out the lifecycle of an error, from publication to correction, and brainstorm possible interventions that make the correction process more transparent and engaging."

This hands-on session will introduce how to create embeddings to help journalists and editors find the right images faster, as well as suggest the most compelling file photos and placement for a given story. Over the course of 75 minutes, participants will learn what embeddings and semantic search are and how to leverage their photo archives to create their own image semantic search system. We'll go beyond using AI tools for text analysis and generation and explore other ways AI can play a role in creating richer story packages for our audiences. Along the way, we'll discuss human-in-the-loop guardrails and the limitations of creating tools like this, and have a conversation about how a tool like this can fit into news production workflows in your newsrooms."

Increasingly, particularly legacy outlets are struggling with the latter; 43% of Americans say they avoid the news and distrust in news institutions is growing. 
        
        \nCommunities of creators on social media have learned a new set of tools to connect with people, often less through explicit strategy and more through responsive experimentation. This session will explore how those lessons can be translated back to journalism \u2014 in more and less literal ways. 
        
        \nThis session will begin with a brief presentation to frame the issues under discussion. We\u2019ll then screen a selection of impactful news videos from social media creators and discuss as a group the techniques they\u2019re using: what production styles, visual choices, creative tools and narrative modes are they using? How is this helping them connect? 
        
        \nAfter identifying common threads as a group, we\u2019ll move to a brainstorm of how these modes could be applied to journalism generally, on social media or off? What tips or inspiration could reporters take in terms of how they build and share their stories? The end result will be a set of new ideas about how journalists can engage with the communities they serve."

Project leads from several participating newsrooms will talk about what it has been like to drive AI projects forward in their own organizations – and how collaborating with AJP and other newsrooms has helped.
        
        \nThen all participants will break into small groups and compare notes about implementing AI in their organizations, and overcoming cultural and resource constraints. We'll end by sharing some wins and possibilities for others to bring home to their newsrooms. Participants will especially be encouraged to find areas for direct collaboration with peer newsrooms or open source project initiatives."
